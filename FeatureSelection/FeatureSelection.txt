Three benefits of performing feature selection before modeling your data are:

Reduces Overfitting: Less redundant data means less opportunity to make decisions based on noise.
Improves Accuracy: Less misleading data means modeling accuracy improves.
Reduces Training Time: Less data means that algorithms train faster.
